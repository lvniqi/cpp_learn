# GetLogger.php

If you need to use GetLogger.php, you should set the date.timezone option in you php.ini file to suppress The following Warning:

	PHP Warning:  date(): It is not safe to rely on the system's timezone settings. You are *required* to use the date.timezone setting or the date_default_timezone_set() function. In case you used any of those methods and you are still getting this warning, you most likely misspelled the timezone identifier. We selected 'Asia/Chongqing' for 'CST/8.0/no DST' instead in /data/git/cpp_learn/php_learn/libs/log4php-2.3.0/pattern/LoggerPatternConverterDate.php on line 89
